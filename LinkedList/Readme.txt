You can run my program by running the LinkedListRunner.java file. The tests and results that should occur are explained in the comments.

0. The expected run times of the methods is O(n) for most cases but can be O(1) in special cases when the objects being accessed are near the front.
1. LinkedList is better on add and remove methods but worse on get and set methods than Vector.
2. You can simply name the methods there and implement them in the LinkedList class instead.
3. Doubly Linked Lists have two references, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
4. In a circularly linked list the last node points back to the first. You could use it in a game for example where players are taking turns. When the last player moves, it goes back to the first player and cycle continues.
