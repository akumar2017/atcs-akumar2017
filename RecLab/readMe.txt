I am using the Pingry created CSV in my program. However, any data sheet could be used if the readCSV method was adjusted accordingly. My program is currently fully functional for Approach B. I have hardcoded in the user to get recommendations for but it can be adjusted to any user in the list. The output is three shows that the user has not seen before taken from the user who has the most compatibility. Compatibility was measured using the Approach B method. I will try Approach C as well.
